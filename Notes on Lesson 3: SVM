- SVMs draws hyperplanes to separate data points
- They are mainly used for classification but can be used for regression as well
- The best hyperplane is the one that maximizes the margin, that is the distance between nearest points from either classes
- Two important parameters in SKlearn SVMs are C and gamma
- C: controls the tradeoff between smoothness and correctness where a high value favors correctness
- gamma: controls how fine "intricate" the decision boundary is where a high value is more intricate
- gamma: formally, it controls how much far/close points matter where high value means close points weigh more and far ones are mostly neglected
- Q: what defines a close/far point?
- Q: how does gamma and C affect each other?
- The kernel in SVC in SKlearn has a default value 'rbf'
- RBF: Radial Basis Function. RBF maps the features to a infinite dimension vector space represented in an infinite sum of polynomials.

- Starting the mini project I faced this error: "UnpicklingError: the STRING opcode argument must be quoted"
that happened due to changing pickle to joblib and other changes when the starter code was migrated to python 3.
- In this [issue](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects/issues/351) there is a fix to this error.
