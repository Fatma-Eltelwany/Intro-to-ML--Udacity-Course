# Intro-to-ML--Udacity-Course
This repo will include all the mini projects in Udacity's introductory machine learning course.
Link to the course: https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120
All the needed files for these mini projects are here: https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git, in the course you wil need to clone it to start using the files.
The course goes over some machine learning algorithims. By the end of each lesson, there is a mini project to get your hands working through the algorithim.
Every project in this repository corresponds to a mini project at the ends of the lessons with the same order.
Lesson 2 is the beginning since lesson 1 is just an introduction to the course.
