- Decision trees are used for classification and regression.
- They can deal with non-linearity through splitting features at certain boundaries
- Data imputrity is how clear a certain domain is of points that belong to another domain, it is measured through entropy
- Entropy: controls where a decision tree decides to split the data (that is at which values of the features the tree branches). 
  It is a measure of data impurity 
- The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.
